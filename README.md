# Linear_regression

Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in python.

In this repo I have implemented three classes of Linearregression, Ridgeregression(linear regression with L2 regularization), and logistic regression by using adagrad optimization (implemented as well). Each class contains functions fit() and predict() with exception of logistic regression that contains an extra function of predict_proba().

test_class.py and test_regr.py are scripts designed by my professor Dr.Parr to test my implementation aginst Scikit-learn's.
